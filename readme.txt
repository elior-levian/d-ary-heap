PROGRAM INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
After starting the program, input a positive integer d for d-heap, the heap will 
be built from reading numbers separated by commas in the "numbers.txt" file in the directory
automatically, the numbers should not have more than 5 digits.
In the menu, you need to input only the numbers 1 to 5 to access the program's
features like so:

1) Extract max value from d-heap - input 1 to extract max value from the heap.

2) Insert new value to d-heap - input 2 to insert new value to heap.

3) Increase the value of a key at a certain index - input 3 to use increase key function

4) Print current d-heap - input 4 to print the current array as a heap,
the print function prints the heap as an array and also as a heap, providing what numbers
are at each given level. 

5) Quit program - input 5 to quit current instance of program.

I've added 2 number.txt files, one for d=2 and one for d=3 and screenshots that show 
the program using them.
NOTE: the program reads the "numbers.txt" file only, unless changed, you should only change it's
contents, the numbers.txt file comes preloaded with the d=2 text.
